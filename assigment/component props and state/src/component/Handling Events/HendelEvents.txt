Question 1: How are events handled in React compared to vanilla JavaScript? Explain the
concept of synthetic events.
Ans: In React, events are handled using a system of synthetic events, which are cross-browser wrappers around native JavaScript events, ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers. This differs from vanilla JavaScript where you directly interact with the DOM and its events. 

Question 2: What are some common event handlers in React.js? Provide examples of
onClick, onChange, and onSubmit.
Ans: In React.js, common event handlers include onClick for clicks, onChange for input changes, and onSubmit for form submissions, with examples provided below to demonstrate their usage. 

Question 3: Why do you need to bind event handlers in class components?
Ans:While working on React, you must have come across controlled components and event handlers. We need to bind these methods to the component instance using .bind() in our custom componentâ€™s constructor.
