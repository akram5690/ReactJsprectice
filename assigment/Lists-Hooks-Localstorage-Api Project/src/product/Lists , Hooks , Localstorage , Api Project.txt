Question 1: How do you render a list of items in React? Why is it important to use keyswhen
rendering lists?
Ans: Keys help React efficiently update and re-render the list by identifying which items have changed, been added, or removed. 

Question 2: What are keys in React, and what happens if you do not provide a unique key?
Ans: React must search through the entire list to determine which component has changed.


                                    Hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer, useMemo, useRef, useCallback)

Question 1: What are React hooks? How do useState() and useEffect() hooks work in
functional components?
Ans:React Hooks are functions that let functional components manage state and lifecycle features. They were introduced in React 16.8 to avoid using class components. useState() is for managing local component state.useEffect() is for handling side effects after rendering

Question 2: What problems did hooks solve in React development? Why are hooks
considered an important addition to React?
Ans: React Hooks primarily addressed the limitations of managing state and side effects within functional components, which traditionally lacked these capabilities in React. They also provided a more streamlined way to reuse logic across components and simplified the overall React development process. 

Question 3: What is useReducer ? How we use in react app?
Ans: The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.It allows for custom state logic.If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be useful

Question 4: What is the purpose of useCallback & useMemo Hooks?
Ans: Both are used to optimize React components by preventing unnecessary re-renders or re-computations. 

Question 5: Whatâ€™s the Difference between the useCallback & useMemo Hooks?
Ans: The useCallback and useMemo Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function.

Question 6 : What is useRef ? How to work in react app?
Ans:The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
